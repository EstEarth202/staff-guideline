## Verifying a Datapack

A datapack **must** follow all of **Tier 3** conventions to be verified and any datapack that does not follow **Tier 2** conventions will be notify as a warning.

Every verification must be report back to the creator, This can be done in any way as you wish. Such as via private messaging or `#üìçrequest-review` channel.

When the datapack is verified, you can post it to `#‚úÖcertified-datapacks` channel in the following format:
```
<Datapack name> by <Creator name>
<url to the project page>
```
This can also be change if see fit and you need notify them that they can use the convention banner in their project page.

> As of right now, I only made a page for Tier 3 conventions. The lower tier will be made later.
