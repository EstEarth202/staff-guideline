# Datapack Advancement

You should rely on this guideline instead of spamming the installation message onto the chat which can be annoying for users when installing multiple datapacks.

## About

This guideline aims to generalize the installation message into an easily viewable and non-obstructive way by putting it on a single advancement page.

## Preview

This is an example of what this guideline will look like

## Implementation

The guideline is made up of 3 advancement nodes: `Root`, `Namespace` and `Datapack`

## 1. Root Advancement

This advancement is the root of all installed datapack's advancements.

![](./style/advancement-root.png)

You **must** create this file at `/data/global/advancements/root.json`.

```json
{
    "display": {
        "title": "Installed Datapacks",
        "description": "",
        "icon": {
            "item": "minecraft:knowledge_book"
        },
        "background": "minecraft:textures/block/gray_concrete.png",
        "show_toast": false,
        "announce_to_chat": false
    },
    "criteria": {
        "trigger": {
            "trigger": "minecraft:tick"
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Namespace Advancement

This advancement indicates the creator of the datapack.

![](./style/advancement-namespace.png)

It **must** be in the same location in every datapacks of yours. I recommend that you put it inside `/data/global/advancements/<namespace>.json`.

```json
{
    "display": {
        "title": "<Your name>",
        "description": "",
        "icon": {
            "item": "minecraft:player_head",
            "nbt": "{SkullOwner: '<your_minecraft_name>'}"
        },
        "show_toast": false,
        "announce_to_chat": false
    },
    "parent": "global:root",
    "criteria": {
        "trigger": {
            "trigger": "minecraft:tick"
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**  
> If you are working on a project with multiple people you can choose to:
> - Display this advancement as your own and credit them with other methods.
> - Display this advancement with the "team name" of your choice.
> - Display a "[Standalone Datapack](#extra-standalone-datapack)" instead.

## 3. Datapack Advancement

This advancement is used to display installation information about your datapack. It should be unique among your other datapacks.

![](./style/advancement-datapack.png)

You can create this advancement anywhere as long as you **don't** pollute `/data/global/advancements/folder`

```json
{
    "display": {
        "title": "<datapack name>",
        "description": "<datapack description>",
        "icon": {
            "item": "<item>"
        },
        "announce_to_chat": false,
        "show_toast": false
    },
    "parent": "global:<namespace>",
    "criteria": {
        "trigger": {
            "trigger": "minecraft:tick"
        }
    }
}
```

## Note

The syntax `<...>` indicates that you have to replace it with something else!

## Extra: Standalone Datapack

This is an optional syntax that you can take to display installed datapack *without* displaying the creator's information.

To implement this you simply skip the [#2: Namespace Advancement](#2-namespace-advancement) step and make sure that in step [#3: Datapack Advancement](#3-datapack-advancement) you create your file inside `/data/global/advancements/standalone/` directory.

> Keep in mind that if you are planning to release more datapacks under this name. You should use the normal syntax over this one.
