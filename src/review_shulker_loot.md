## Shulker Box Loot Table (***)

> This step can be skipped if the datapack does not require Player Inventory manipulation to play.

To verify this convention, You must compare the loot table inside `data/minecraft/loot_tables/blocks/yellow_shulker_box.json` with [this loot table](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/conventions/shulker_box_loot_table.html)

- If the datapack uses *other* shulker box for inventory manipulation they will get a warning but will still pass.
- If the datapack use yellow shulker box but with different loot table, they will not pass this convention.
