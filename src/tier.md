# Tier System

Each convention has a varying degree of importance, this system is put in place to categorized the importance of each convention.

|Levels|About|
|-------|-----|
|Tier 1|A convention that doesn't contribute to ensuring compatibility between datapacks, **or** a convention that has just been newly voted in|
|Tier 2|Transition phase from Tier 1 to Tier 3, This also serve as an adoption phase to encourage datapacker to follow these conventions to ensure compatibility in the future.|
|Tier 3|The most important conventions that **must** be followed to ensure compatibility. Every datapacks is required to follow this convention, or it will break otherwise.|

## Promoting a convention

A convention can be promoted into a higher tier if it fits in any of the following conditions:

- **Tier 1** Convention cannot ensure compatibility without forcing that every datapack must follow it. (Tier 1 -> Tier 2)
- **Tier 2** Convention has been adopted into a certain amount of datapacks. (Tier 2 -> Tier 3)

On the contrary, a convention can also be demoted into lower-tier if the compatibility the convention ensures become obsolete with the new update or the majority of datapackers sees so.

## Shorthand

The tier can also be represented as a `*` symbol.

- Tier 1 -> `*`
- Tier 2 -> `**`
- Tier 3 -> `***`

This can be attached after the convention name like so: `Datapack Advancement (*)`, `Common Trait Convention (**)`, `Shulker Box Loot Table (***)`
